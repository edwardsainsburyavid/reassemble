Reassembler:

To run directly: 

run: `java -cp target/Reassembler-3.0.jar org.edwardsainsbury.reassembler.Reassembler PathToFile.txt`

Alternatively:

Put the test file, strictly named tests.txt, in the root of this directory then run: `./BuildAndRun.sh.` This will build and 
run a dockerised image of the application and run all tests.
